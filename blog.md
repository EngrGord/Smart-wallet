Storing the signed messages on a separate contract and handling the recovery process within the smart contract has some advantages and disadvantages when compared to storing the signed messages on a backend and handling the recovery process outside the smart contract.

Advantages of storing the signed messages on a separate contract include:

    Decentralization: Allowing users to recover their assets without the need for a centralized intermediary improves the decentralization of the system.
    Transparency: All the signed messages and recovery process are visible on the blockchain, providing transparency and immutability.
    Security: Smart contracts can be audited and their code is publicly available, making it easier to identify and fix security vulnerabilities.

Disadvantages of storing the signed messages on a separate contract include:

    Cost: Storing data on the blockchain is more expensive than storing it on a backend.
    UX: It may be more user-friendly to handle the recovery process outside of the smart contract, as it allows for more flexibility and customization in the recovery process.
    Scalability: Storing large amounts of data on the blockchain can be a scalability concern, as the blockchain's storage capacity is limited.

Storing the signed messages on a backend and handling the recovery process outside the smart contract has its own advantages and disadvantages.

Advantages of storing the signed messages on a backend include:

    Cost: Storing data on a backend is less expensive than storing it on the blockchain.
    UX: It can be more user-friendly to handle the recovery process outside of the smart contract, as it allows for more flexibility and customization in the recovery process.
    Scalability: Storing large amounts of data on a backend is less of a scalability concern than storing it on the blockchain.

Disadvantages of storing the signed messages on a backend include:

Disadvantages of storing the signed messages on a backend include:

    Security: Backend systems are more vulnerable to hacks and data breaches as they are centralized and not transparent.
    Decentralization: The recovery process relies on a centralized intermediary, which reduces the decentralization of the system.
    Transparency: The recovery process is not visible on the blockchain and may not be auditable.

Ultimately, the choice of whether to store the signed messages on a separate contract or a backend depends on the specific requirements of the application and the trade-offs that are acceptable for the use case. Factors such as cost, user experience, scalability, security, and decentralization should be carefully considered when making this decision.


If Obi is an owner of the SafeWallet contract and has Ada, Chijoke and Oba as authorized signers, and Obi's private key was exposed while trying to push code to GitHub, the recover function can be used to secure Obi's assets in the following way:

    Obi would need to contact Ada, Chijoke and Oba and request them to sign a message using their private keys. The message could be something like "I authorize the recovery of the SafeWallet contract by [msg.sender]".

    Once all three authorized signers have signed the message, they would need to provide the signed message, along with the _v, _r, and _s values, to the msg.sender.

    The msg.sender would then call the recover function, passing in the signed message, _v, _r, and _s values as arguments.

    The contract would first check that the msg.sender has not recovered the wallet yet by using the require(!recovered[msg.sender]) statement.

    The contract would then use the ecrecover function to recover the address that signed the message and check that it is an authorized signer for the msg.sender by using require(authorizedSigners[signer][msg.sender]) statement.

    The contract would then add the msg.sender to the authorizedRecover mapping by using `

Why is step number 4 neccesary

Step 4 is necessary to ensure that the msg.sender has not recovered the wallet yet. If the msg.sender had already recovered the wallet, it would mean that the private key associated with the wallet is already compromised and therefore, it would not be necessary to recover the wallet again. Additionally, if an attacker were to try to recover the wallet multiple times, it would be possible to drain the balance of the wallet. By checking that the msg.sender has not recovered the wallet yet, the contract can ensure that the recovery process is only performed once and prevent any malicious actions from taking place.

who will provide the signedMessasage input 

In the scenario I described, the authorized signers that Obi had previously designated (Ada, Chijoke, and Oba) will provide the signed message input to the msg.sender. Each authorized signer will use their own private key to sign the message provided by Obi, and then provide the signed message, along with the _v, _r, and _s values, to the msg.sender. It is important that the msg.sender verifies the authenticity of the signed message before using it to call the recover function, as an attacker could potentially provide a fake signed message in order to try to recover the wallet maliciously.
Chijioke Ogbuanya
how many signedMessages does msg.sender need to recover wallet

The number of signed messages that the msg.sender needs to recover the wallet depends on the threshold set for the number of authorized signers needed to recover the wallet. In the scenario I described, the threshold is set to 2, meaning that the msg.sender will need the signed messages from at least 2 of the 3 authorized signers (Ada, Chijoke, and Oba) in order to recover the wallet. The threshold can be set to any number from 1 to the total number of authorized signers, depending on the desired level of security for the wallet. The higher the threshold, the more signatures are required to recover the wallet and the more secure the wallet will be.

how many time will msg.sender need to call the recover function

The msg.sender will need to call the recover function only once, as long as the msg.sender has the required number of signed messages from authorized signers. Once the recover function is called, it will check the validity of the signed messages and the authenticity of the signers by using the require statements to ensure the msg.sender is an authorized signer, and that the msg.sender has not recovered the wallet yet. If the function returns successfully, it will change the owner of the wallet and mark the msg.sender as recovered.

It's worth mentioning that, msg.sender should be careful when calling the recover function as he needs to make sure he has the right number of signed messages from authorized signers, otherwise, the function will fail, and the recovery process will not be successful.
Chijioke Ogbuanya
how will the function take more than one signed message from msg.sender

The recover function is designed to take a single signed message as an input, along with the _v, _r and _s values. In order to take multiple signed messages from authorized signers, the msg.sender will need to call the recover function multiple times, each time passing in a different signed message and its corresponding _v, _r and _s values.

However, to simplify the process and make it more efficient, it's a better practice to have a separate contract that can hold all the signed messages, and the recover function can call it and check all the signed messages at once. This way, msg.sender can submit all the signed messages to the separate contract, and call the recover function only once, and the function will iterate through all the messages in the separate contract to check if the threshold is met.

It's worth mentioning that, the msg.sender should only call the recover function once all the signed messages have been collected and ready to be used.


Yes, there are decentralized options for storing and managing data that can serve as a backend for the recovery process. These decentralized options, known as decentralized storage networks, allow for data to be stored on a decentralized network of nodes rather than a centralized server. Some examples of decentralized storage networks include:

    IPFS (InterPlanetary File System)
    Filecoin
    Sia
    Storj
    Swarm

These decentralized storage networks provide a way to store data in a decentralized manner while still allowing for easy retrieval and management. They can be used to store the signed messages, and the recovery process can be handled within smart contracts using this data.

It's worth noting that these decentralized storage networks are still relatively new and their scalability, security, and the cost might be a concern, but they are becoming more mature and popular.


To store the signed messages on the Filecoin network, we can create a new contract that serves as a storage and retrieval layer for these messages. This contract can be interacted with using the Filecoin.js library, which is currently being maintained and is up to date.

Here is an example of how this might look in code:

pragma solidity ^0.8.17;
import "https://github.com/filecoin-project/filecoin.js/contracts/Filecoin.sol";

contract SignedMessageStorage {
    Filecoin filecoin;

    constructor() public {
        filecoin = new Filecoin();
    }

    function storeSignedMessage(bytes32 _signedMessage) public {
        // Use the Filecoin.js library to convert the bytes32 message to a CID (Content Identifier)
        bytes32 cid = filecoin.bytes32ToCID(_signedMessage);
        // Use the Filecoin contract to store the CID on the Filecoin network
        filecoin.store(cid);
    }

    function retrieveSignedMessage(bytes32 _cid) public view returns (bytes32) {
        // Use the Filecoin contract to retrieve the message based on the CID
        bytes32 signedMessage = filecoin.retrieve(_cid);
        return signedMessage;
    }
}

In the example above, we use the Filecoin.sol contract from the Filecoin.js library to interact with the Filecoin network. The storeSignedMessage() function takes a bytes32 signed message as input and converts it to a CID using the bytes32ToCID() function provided by the library. The CID is then stored on the Filecoin network using the store() function. The retrieveSignedMessage() function takes a CID as input and retrieves the signed message from the Filecoin network using the retrieve() function.

In the original SafeWallet contract, you would need to call the storeSignedMessage function to store the signed message on the filecoin network before calling the recover function, and also need to call the retrieveSignedMessage function to retrieve the stored signed message from the filecoin network.

// Filecoin Contract
pragma solidity ^0.8.17;

contract FilecoinSignedMessages {
    address public owner;
    mapping(address => bytes32[]) public signedMessages;
    uint public threshold;

    event RecoveryReady();

    constructor() public {
        owner = msg.sender;
        threshold = 2;
    }

    function addSignedMessage(address _address, bytes32 _signedMessage) public {
        signedMessages[_address].push(_signedMessage);
        if (signedMessages[_address].length >= threshold) {
            emit RecoveryReady();
        }
    }

    function getSignedMessages(address _address) public view returns (bytes32[] memory) {
        return signedMessages[_address];
    }
}

// SafeWallet Contract
pragma solidity ^0.8.17;

contract SafeWallet {
    address public owner;
    mapping(address => bool) public recovered;
    FilecoinSignedMessages filecoinSignedMessages;

    constructor() public {
        owner = msg.sender;
        filecoinSignedMessages = new FilecoinSignedMessages();
    }

    function recover(address _address) public {
        require(!recovered[_address]);
        bytes32[] memory signedMessages = filecoinSignedMessages.getSignedMessages(_address);
        for (uint i = 0; i < signedMessages.length; i++) {
            bytes32 signedMessage = signedMessages[i];
            // Do ecrecover here and check if recovered address is authorized
            // If any of the signed messages are not valid, revert the transaction
        }
        owner = _address;
        recovered[_address] = true;
    }

    function addSignedMessage(bytes32 _signedMessage) public {
        filecoinSignedMessages.addSignedMessage(msg.sender, _signedMessage);
    }
}

In the example above, the Filecoin contract stores the signed messages and tracks the number of signed messages that have been received. Once the threshold is reached, it emits the "RecoveryReady" event. The SafeWallet

To interact with the Filecoin contract and verify the number of signatures collected, the SafeWallet contract can use the web3.js library to call the necessary functions on the Filecoin contract. The signed messages can be stored on the Filecoin contract as a string or byte array and can be accessed via the contract's public variables. Once the threshold number of signatures has been reached, the msg.sender can call the recover function and pass in all the required signed messages as input. The recover function can then use the web3.js library to interact with the Filecoin contract and retrieve the stored signed messages, verify that the required number of signatures have been collected, and execute the recovery process.

Here is an example of how the recover function can be implemented to interact with the Filecoin contract and retrieve the stored signed messages:

function recover(address _filecoinContractAddress) public {
    // Verify that the msg.sender has not already recovered the wallet
    require(!recovered[msg.sender]);
    // Verify that the msg.sender is an authorized recover address
    require(authorizedRecover[msg.sender]);
    // Create an instance of the Filecoin contract
    Filecoin storageContract = Filecoin(_filecoinContractAddress);
    // Retrieve the number of signatures collected
    uint256 signatureCount = storageContract.getSignatureCount();
    // Verify that the threshold number of signatures has been reached
    require(signatureCount >= threshold);
    // Retrieve the stored signed messages
    bytes32[] memory signatures = storageContract.getSignatures();
    // Verify that the signatures are valid
    for (uint256 i = 0; i < signatureCount; i++) {
        address signer = ecrecover(keccak256(signatures[i]), v[i], r[i], s[i]);
        require(authorizedSigners[signer]);
    }
    // Change the owner to the address that called the function
    owner = msg.sender;
    // mark the address as recovered
    recovered[msg.sender] = true;
}

It is possible to generate the signature on the front-end using a library like Ethers.js and then send it to the Filecoin contract to serve as storage for the signatures until the threshold is reached. This approach has some advantages:

    It keeps the sensitive private key on the client-side, which provides an extra layer of security and prevents the private key from being exposed on the Filecoin contract or the blockchain.

    It allows the user to review and confirm the signature before sending it to the Filecoin contract, which helps to prevent accidental or malicious signature submissions.

    It allows the user to have more control over the signature process and can provide a better user experience.

However, this approach also has some limitations, it may introduce additional complexity and overhead to the process, and it may also require additional development effort to implement. Additionally, it may also require the user to have a device with a secure environment to sign the message.

In any case, it's important to consider the security and user experience trade-offs and choose the approach that best suits the specific requirements of the contract and the use case.

The toAddress() function is used to convert a regular Ethereum address (address payable) to the Filecoin specific address (address.Address) type.

Filecoin addresses have a different format than Ethereum addresses, so this function is needed to convert the Ethereum address to the correct format for use within the Filecoin network.

This function takes a single parameter, an Ethereum address, and it uses the built-in address.new() function to convert the Ethereum address to the correct format for use within the Filecoin network.

It's important to note that some of the functions in this contract such as addSignature and getSignatures are using address.Address as input while other functions like checkThresholdReached and setThreshold are using address payable so the use of toAddress function is to convert the address payload to the right format that is supported by the contract.

Storage providers and storage deals are an important aspect of the Filecoin network as they determine where the data is stored and how much it costs to store it.

In the case of this contract, it is only storing small amounts of data (the signatures) so the storage requirements are relatively low. However, it is important to keep in mind that as the number of signatures increases, the storage requirements of the contract will also increase. It's important to consider the cost of storing this data on the Filecoin network and to make sure that the cost is sustainable in the long term.

One way to handle this is by choosing a storage provider that offers a low cost for storage and also offers a reliable service. Additionally, you could also consider using a storage deal that allows you to set a budget for the storage and automatically renew the deal when the budget is exhausted.

Another way to handle this is to set a limit on the number of signatures that can be stored in the contract and deleting older signatures when the limit is reached. This will keep the storage cost under control while ensuring that the important data is still accessible.

It's also important to note that this contract is just an example and it may require additional testing and tweaks before being deployed on the Filecoin network. It's also important to consider other security and performance factors before deploying it.
